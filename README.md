## About Us

- **Our Mission**

We are driven by the mission of making learning more stimulating and adapted to the specific challenges of each child. By putting ourselves

in the children's shoes, we have designed a platform that prioritizes their experience and promotes their development. Our goal is to offer

them progression tools through interactive quizzes and personalized monitoring, so that they can achieve their academic goals with

confidence and pleasure.

- **Our Vision**

Welcome to our educational platform dedicated to children aged 6 to 10! This portfolio project for Holberton School in Lille was inspired by

our desire to meet the learning needs of children in a fun and interactive way. We developed this platform with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

using React.js for the frontend,Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database.

As mothers, we wanted to offer children an accessible tool that allows them to progress at their own pace, while having fun.

- **Our Values**

Our platform offers a unique collaborative dimension: it allows parents and teachers to contribute to the enrichment of the database by

adding suggestions for quizzes and educational content.

This functionality will allow us to evolve with the needs of children and strengthen the

educational impact of the platform by integrating the suggestions of those who know their journey best.
